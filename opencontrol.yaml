    The GSA Discovery application is a tool that helps contracting professionals
    and other interested parties conduct market research on GSA contract vehicles
    and their suppliers. Users can search for available vendors by contract and
    NAICS code.  The results can be further filtered down by vendor set-aside
    classifications.  While the current version of Discovery is somewhat
    limited in vendor scope and available data, this system is expected to
    evolve to encompass a wide range of contracting vehicles and vendor related
    information.
