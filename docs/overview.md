# Discovery overview

Discovery is a market research tool for GSA Contract Vehicles. Currently, it features GSA IDIQ vehicles, with more contracts coming in the future. Use Discovery to search vendor history for the awarded contractors and NAICs of the various IDIQs. Each contract is separated into Unrestricted and Small Business (SB) to make it easy to reserve task orders for small business categories.
