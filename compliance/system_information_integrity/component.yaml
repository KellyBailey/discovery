        _Control:_ **The organization identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws**

        The Discovery management team, GSA staff, and contractors currently working on the Discovery application continuously test the system and report bugs and issues with the system.  It is also possible that external contributors might file issues through the GitHub issue queue.

        All information system flaws are added to the Discovery project backlog and prioritized by the Discovery management team in coordination with the Discovery team and other relevant GSA officials.

        _Control:_ **The organization tests software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness and potential side effects before installation**

        All software used to develop the Discovery application is installed, tested, and packaged on an included Virtual Machine image built for Vagrant.  This ensures that there is a standard and isolated environment with which to conduct development of the Discovery application.  On top of the Virtual machine development environment, we create Docker clusters to standardize the application runtime environment.  We align the Docker build and Cloud.gov buildpack as closely as possible to ensure some level of standardization.

        In the future we will replace the Python buildpack with GSA Docker repository hosted images to align all required application infrastructure and dependencies across local development, CI/CD environment, and the various hosting environments.  Cloud.gov allows us to use Docker images on hosted registries instead of buildpacks, and we want to take advantage of this capability to unify and standardize.

        _Control:_ **The organization installs security-relevant software and firmware updates within scheduled monthly patching maintenance windows following change control processes (including testing) with the ability to push emergency patches on demand from either the direction of the CISO or the AO. In terms of vulnerability remediation, High-risk vulnerabilities shall be mitigated within thirty days; moderate risk vulnerabilities mitigated within ninety days of the release of the updates**

        All Discovery application components are updated as time permits or whenever a major security vulnerability is discovered and prioritized by the Discovery management team in coordination with the CISO or Authorizing Official.

        All software is immediately deployed to various host environments subject to passing of unit, acceptance, and other tests, allowing for rapid response to security vulnerabilities.  Vulnerabilities can be found, fixed, and deployed in less than a week in a safe manner that does not disrupt normal operations for users of the Discovery application.

        _Control:_ **The organization incorporates flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management process**

        All non secure Discovery application configurations are version controlled through Git, so configuration changes are pushed and merged along with the code fixes for the flaw remediation process.

        All secure Discovery application configurations can be rotated as needed to maintain security.

        _Control:_ **The organization monitors the information system to detect; 1) Attacks and indicators of potential attacks in accordance with GSA S/SO or Contractor recommendation to be approved and accepted by the GSA AO; and 2) Unauthorized local, network, and remote connections**

        All Discovery application requests are logged, both through Logstash/Kibana and Google Analytics.  Through these two systems we can get a good picture of who is visiting the site, when, for how long, and what parts they are frequenting.

        Since the Discovery application is designed to be used by anonymous people without any restrictions we do not experience unauthorized connections at the application level.  See Cloud.gov SSP Control documentation for more details on the hosting provider process.

        _Control:_ **The organization identifies unauthorized use of the information system through GSA S/SO or Contractor recommendation to be approved and accepted by the GSA AO**

        The Discovery management team authorizes maintainers and administrators when needed to act on the Discovery application system.  There are various roles (such as GitHub maintainer, CircleCI manager, Cloud.gov Space developer, Django administrator) that each have their own functions, documented in the Discovery SSP.  A GSA staff member or current contractor working on the Discovery system may be granted access to any roles needed to perform their GSA approved mission.

        The Discovery management team in coordination with the Authorizing Official may revoke access to one or more roles as deemed necessary.

        _Control:_ **The organization deploys monitoring devices: (i) strategically within the information system to collect organization-determined essential information; and (ii) at ad hoc locations within the system to track specific types of transactions of interest to the organization**

        Currently the Discovery team collects application and hosting provider based logs, and traffic information for the application frontend, but we are currently lacking application performance monitoring through a service like New Relic.  There is a task in the Discovery project backlog to add New Relic monitoring to the Discovery application to more effectively track outages and performance issues.

        When loading data from external sources, such as SAM and FPDS, we collect memory readings over time to track resource efficiency of the update processes.

        _Control:_ **The organization protects information obtained from intrusion-monitoring tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion**

        All documentation related to security monitoring is stored in GSA approved and secured storage mediums, such as Google Drive.  All security related interfaces are secured with least privilege security principles.


    - key: SI-4e

        _Control:_ **The organization heightens the level of information system monitoring activity whenever there is an indication of increased risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of information**

        If the Discovery application were to experience a heightened security threat level, the Discovery team would spend more time researching the various logs and traffic patterns of the users.  If there were security concerns that required constant monitoring the Discovery team would coordinate closely with other relevant security professionals and agencies.


    - key: SI-4f
      text: |
        _Control:_ **The organization obtains legal opinion with regard to information system monitoring activities in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, or regulations**

        When there is a question pertaining to required monitoring activities within the Discovery application system the Discovery team seeks advice from GSA security and legal professionals.

        _Control:_ **The organization provides GSA S/SO or Contractor recommendation to be approved and accepted by the GSA AO**

        Any Discovery manager, GSA staff member, or current contractor working on the Discovery application system can make recommendations and add suggested tasks to the Discovery project backlog (IceBox) that can be prioritized by the Discovery management team in coordination with the GSA Authorizing Official.

        _Control:_ **The information system checks the validity of inputs. They shall be validated for correct syntax and semantics (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) to ensure they match specified definitions for format and content. Input validation protections will be tested through monthly operating system and web application vulnerability scanning as defined in control RA-5**

        The Discovery application is built on the Django web framework which comes with a Query system that escapes queries to prevent SQL injection attacks from user requests or data.  This combined with the current limited number of forms on the fontend display gives us a very small likelihood of attack.

        All known application vulnerabilities are fixed when found, or the Django version is updated with security fixes.
