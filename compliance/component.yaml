        Within the Discovery application (see cloud.gov for lower-level controls), authentication and authorization are currently provided by Django's built in authentication and role mechanisms.  There is one "super administrator" Only users who successfully login through the UAA and who have an associated (via @gsa.gov email address) account in the CALC back end will be able to access privileged areas of the application. Data Administrator users can access the applications' administrative back end, where they can administer, including creating new, user accounts for both Data Administrators and Contract Officers. Contract Officer users are not able to access to access the administrative back end or perform any actions on user accounts.
