        _Control:_ **The information system monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key internal boundaries within the system**

        All Discovery application components are hosted within the Cloud.gov Platform as a Service boundary.  All external access to the Discovery application is gated through an AWS ELB that send traffic to a router that ultimately makes requests of the application Waitress server (WSGI Python web server).

        Internal to Cloud.gov, the Discovery environment is broken up into multiple, near identical, spaces (one production, one staging, and potentially other test environments). Each space has applications and services.  Only the web server has an external route and is accessible through a consistent hostname.  Applications talk to service instances which are protected from outside access.  See Cloud.gov SSP Control documentation for more details on this system.

        All incoming requests and outgoing requests are logged and tracked through a Cloud.gov Logstash / Kibana interface.

        _Control:_ **The information system implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are physically and/or logically separated from internal organizational networks**

        The Discovery application components are logically separated and only accessible in very limited circumstances.  All applications are in their own space (which prevents administrative and development clashes), web accessible application instances are in another subnet than the data services they connect to.  All services have internally generated connection information and credentials assigned at runtime based on system usage and internal rules.  See Cloud.gov SSP Control documentation for more details.

        The application itself is divided into multiple applications.  Currently there are web applications, workers, and schedulers.  Each interacts with each other purely through manipulation of data in the Cloud.gov service tier.

        For local development and CI/CD purposes Docker and Docker Compose are used when possible to encourage a more unified system architecture starting at the underlying OS.  These local clusters maintain their own Docker and virtual machine based networks and are not meant to be accessible from the outside.

        _Control:_ **The information system connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with organizational security architecture**

        The Discovery application system periodically fetches all data that is available through the Discovery API and web interface.  These requests pull publically available data from SAM API registrations and FPDS contract awards and modifications.  All of the data is ingested through worker servers who make HTTPS requests to the underlying API endpoints.  The SAM API is a RESTful interface requiring a Data.gov key, where as FPDS is loaded via ATOM FEEDS for various DUNS numbers.

        All data that we request and that lives within the Discovery database is freely available through other government sources.

        _Control:_ **The information system implements FIPS 140-2 validated encryption modules for digital media stored outside of controlled areas; e-mail; for data on portable storages devices; web sites (internal and public) with logon functions (must also implement TLS); and all sensitive information such as Personally Identifiable Information (as deemed by the data owner) transmitted outside the GSA firewall in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards**

        The Discovery application system does not handle Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or send / receive emails.  The Discovery data consists almost entirely of publically available government supplied information from other APIs and spreadsheets.  The Django system does implement administrative users, which can maintain users, content, and scheduled tasks, but these users have no PII included in their profiles.  All user Django administrative passwords are cryptographically hashed for security.

        The Discovery team strives to follow all guidelines, regulations, and standards relating to encryption of sensitive data, and welcome suggestions from relevant GSA security staff on increasing our security.

        _Control:_ **The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of Personally Identifiable Information and all sensitive information (as deemed by the data owner) on stored data (e.g., database)**

        The Discovery application currently contains no PII that is not already publically available.  The system has a limited number of administrative users, but these accounts have no personal information, and all passwords are hashed to prevent snooping and compromised accounts.
