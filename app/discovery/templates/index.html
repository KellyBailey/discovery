            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p class="about_discovery_text">Discovery is a market research tool for GSA Contract Vehicles. Currently, it features GSA IDIQ vehicles, with more contracts coming in the future. Use Discovery to search vendor history for the awarded contractors and NAICs of the various IDIQs. Some contracts are separated into Unrestricted and Small Business (SB) based on their contract structure. For all other contracts, you can apply small business filters to narrow your results based on any set aside needs you have.</p>

                <span id="data_source_description_sam" class="data_source_description">We pull SAM data directly from the System for Award Management (SAM) to provide supplemental information on all of the vendors on the included contracts, including their SAM registration date, any potential suspensions or debarments, and the NAICS codes that a vendor may contract under. Set aside information is based on contract awarded designations and may not be consistent with the current SAM registration. Contract awarded designations are valid for the term of the contract.</span>
                <div id="data_source_dialog_sam_wrapper"><div id="data_source_dialog_sam" style="display: none"><span>Contractors are required to re-certify size/socioeconimic at least annually in SAM in accordance with <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/html/Subpart%204_12.html#wp1073667" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAR 4.120(b)(1)</a>. Contrast that with the contract frequency every five years (or Novation/merger) in accordance with <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/html/52_217_221.html#wp1139913" target="_blank">FAR 52.219-28</a>. Hence the size/socioeconomic status shown in SAM may differ from the contract and thus cannot be relied upon for orders issued under the contract which default to the size/socioeconomic status in the contract. Refer to the contract vehicle website to determine the current size/socioeconomic status of a particular contractor under that contract vehicle. )</span></div></div>
