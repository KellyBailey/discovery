      <h2>Discovery Features</h2>
      <p class="usa-font-lead">GSA IDIQ vehicles, with more contracts coming in the future. Use Discovery to search
        vendor history for the awarded contractors and NAICs of the various IDIQs. Some contracts are separated into
        Unrestricted and Small Business (SB) based on their contract structure. For all other contracts, you can apply
        small business filters to narrow your results based on any set aside needs you have.</p>

      <h2>How to use Discovery</h2>
      <p class="usa-font-lead">Discovery lets you pick and choose different criteria in order to narrow down contracts
        to find one that suits your needs. Select any of the listed filters to view lists of vendors available based on
        the selected criteria. The other filters will update as you select certain fields. Select the “All” options to
        clear them. Once you’ve selected one or more options from the dropdowns, you can then click through to the
        vendor’s pages to see contract history and registration data for each vendor.</p>

        <h3>Data Sources</h3>
        <p><em>last updated: <strong>08/25/2018</strong></em><strong>SAM</strong></p>

        <p>We pull SAM data directly from the System for Award Management (SAM) to provide
          supplemental information on
          all
          of the vendors on the included contracts, including their SAM registration date, any potential suspensions or
          debarments,
          and the NAICS codes that a vendor may contract under. Set aside information is based on contract awarded
          designations
          and may not be consistent with the current SAM registration. Contract awarded designations are valid for the
          term
          of the contract.</p>

        <h3>FPDS</h3>
        <p><em>last updated: <strong>08/24/2018</strong></em>
          <p>Discovery loads data from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) to automatically
            provide you with a
            context-rich
            contract history for each vendor, including the amount of the contract, the primary NAICS code and the
            pricing
            type.</p>
          <p><strong>What are Service Categories?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Discovery’s IDIQs are divided into functional categories that are referred to as service categories</li>
            <li>If your contracting need spans multiple categories, choose the one that contains the preponderance of
              your
              work.
              Selecting the most relevant NAICS code above will guide you to the correct service category</li>
