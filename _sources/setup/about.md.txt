## Overview

Welcome to the wonderful world of procurement, a mechanism by which the government buys goods and services from the private sector. The procurement process is made up of several stages, one of the earliest being market research. Market Research is an attempt to predict what qualified bidders your solicitation for goods or services will attract. It helps acquisition personnel make decisions regarding various aspects of their particular procurement. Ideally, a solicitation should be structured so that it attracts a enough experienced bidders to be truly competitive.

After researching the marketplace, procurement officers may decide to break their solicitation up into smaller chunks, or choose one vehicle or schedule over another. Procurement vehicles and schedules are large umbrella contracts, with a set of vendors that have "pre-competed" for work in a general category.

To meet this need GSA is developing Discovery, a market research tool for GSA Contract Vehicles. Currently, it features GSA IDIQ vehicles, with more contracts coming in the future. Use Discovery to search vendor history for the awarded contractors and NAICs of the various IDIQs. Each contract is separated into Unrestricted and Small Business (SB) to make it easy to reserve task orders for small business categories.

## Where we're at

Discovery was developed to serve the [OASIS family of  vehicles](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/161367), which has many vendors capable of providing integrated professional services. OASIS is actually two vehicles, OASIS SB, which includes small businesses only, and OASIS unrestricted, which includes a wider array of vendors.

Discovery is currently live at (https://discovery.gsa.gov).
